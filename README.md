A Go (golang) [Custom Flutter Engine
Embedder](https://github.com/flutter/engine/wiki/Custom-Flutter-Engine-Embedders)
for desktop

# Purpose
This project doesn't compete with
[this](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding) awesome one.
The purpose of this project is to support the 
[Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) framework on Windows, MacOS, and
Linux using a **SINGLE** code base.  

[**GLFW**](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) fits the job because it
provides the right abstractions over the OpenGL's Buffer/mouse/keyboard for each platform.  

The choice of [Golang](https://github.com/golang/go) comes from the fact that it
has the same tooling on every platform.  
Plus golang is a great language because it keeps everything simple and readable,
which, I hope, will encourage people to contribute :grin:.

## How to install

<details>
<summary> :package: :penguin: Linux</summary>
<h4>From binaries</h4>
Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Drakirus/go-flutter-desktop-embedder/releases">Release</a> page for prebuilt versions.

<h4>From source</h4>

Go read first: [go-gl/glfw](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw/)  


```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Drakirus/go-flutter-desktop-embedder.git
cd go-flutter-desktop-embedder

# Build the flutter simpleDemo project
cd example/simpleDemo/
cd flutter_project/demo/
flutter build bundle
cd ../..

# Download the share library, the one corresponding to your flutter version.
go run engineDownloader.go

# REQUIRED before every `go build`. The CGO compiler need to know where to look for the share library
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L${PWD}"
# The share library must stay next to the generated binary.

# Get the libraries
go get -u -v github.com/Drakirus/go-flutter-desktop-embedder

# Make sure the path in "main.go" to the `icudtl.dat` is correct.
# Build the example project
go build main.go

# `go run main.go` is not working ATM.
```
