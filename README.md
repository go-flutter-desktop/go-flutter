## Purpose

[Flutter](http://flutter.io/) allows you to build beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase.

This [unofficial](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/issues/191#issuecomment-511384007) project brings Flutter to the desktop through the power of [Go](http://golang.org/) and [GLFW](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw).

The flutter engine itself doesn't know how to deal with desktop platforms _(eg handling mouse/keyboard input)_. Instead, it exposes an abstraction layer for whatever platform to implement. This project implements the [Flutter's Embedding API](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Custom-Flutter-Engine-Embedders) using a single code base that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For rendering, [**GLFW**](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) fits the job because it provides the right abstractions over the OpenGL's Buffer/Mouse/Keyboard for each platform. 

The choice of [Golang](https://github.com/golang/go) comes from the fact that it has the same tooling on every platform. Plus Golang is a great language because it keeps everything simple and readable, which makes it easy to build cross-platform plugins.

## Getting started

The best way to get started is to install [hover](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/hover), the official go-flutter tool to set up, build and run Flutter apps on the desktop, including hot-reload.

Read the [hover tutorial](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/hover) to run your app on the desktop, or start with [one of our example apps](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/examples).

If you want more in-depth information about go-flutter, read the [wiki](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/wiki).

## Examples

A separate repository contains example Flutter apps that also run on the desktop. Go to [github.com/go-flutter-desktop/examples](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/examples) to give them a try.

## Plugins

Some popular plugins are already implemented over at [github.com/go-flutter-desktop/plugins](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/plugins).
If you have implemented a plugin that you would like to share, feel free to open a PR on the plugins repository!  

For a detailed tutorial on how to create a plugin, read the [wiki](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/wiki/Implement-a-plugin).

## Version compatibility

### Flutter version

Flutter itself is a relatively young project. Its framework and engine are updated often. The go-flutter project tries to stay compatible with the [beta channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels) of Flutter.

### Go version

Updating Go is simple and Go [seldomly has backwards-incompatible changes](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat). This project remains compatible with the [latest Go stable release](https://golang.org/dl/).

### GLFW version

This project uses go-gl/glfw for GLFW v3.3.
