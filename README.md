# go-flutter - A package that brings Flutter to the desktop

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter](https://badges.gitter.im/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter.svg)](hhttps://gitter.im/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Purpose

[Flutter](http://flutter.io/) allows you to build beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase.

This project brings Flutter to the desktop through the power of [Go](http://golang.org/) and [GLFW](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw).

The flutter engine itself doesn't know how to deal with desktop platforms _(eg handling mouse/keyboard input)_. Instead, it exposes an abstraction layer for whatever platform to implement. This project implements the [Flutter's Embedding API](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Custom-Flutter-Engine-Embedders) using a single code base that runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. For rendering, [**GLFW**](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) fits the job because it provides the right abstractions over the OpenGL's Buffer/Mouse/Keyboard for each platform. 

The choice of [Golang](https://github.com/golang/go) comes from the fact that it has the same tooling on every platform. Plus Golang is a great language because it keeps everything simple and readable, which makes it easy to build cross-platform plugins.

## How to install

<details>
<summary> :package: :penguin: Linux</summary>
<h4>From binaries</h4>
Check out the <a href="https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/releases">Release</a> page for prebuilt versions.

<h4>From source</h4>

Go read first: [go-gl/glfw](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw/)  


```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter.git
cd go-flutter

# Build the flutter simpleDemo project
cd example/simpleDemo/
cd flutter_project/demo/
flutter build bundle
cd ../..

# Download the share library, the one corresponding to your flutter version.
go run engineDownloader.go

# REQUIRED before every `go build`. The CGO compiler need to know where to look for the share library
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L${PWD}"
# The share library must stay next to the generated binary.

# Get the libraries
go get -u -v github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter

# Build the example project
go build main.go

# `go run main.go` is not working ATM.
```

## Version compatibility

### Flutter version

Flutter is a relatively new project. It's framework and engine are updated often. This project tries to stay compatible with the [beta channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels) of flutter.

### Go version

Updating Go is simple, and Go [seldomly has backwards incompatible changes](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat). This project remains compatible with the [latest Go stable release](https://golang.org/dl/).

### GLFW version

This project uses go-gl/glfw for GLFW v3.2.
